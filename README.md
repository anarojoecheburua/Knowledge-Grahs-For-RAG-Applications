# Knowledge Graphs for RAG Applications 🌐

Learn how to implement knowledge graphs for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications by following this step-by-step tutorial to enhance AI responses with structured knowledge. 🚀

## Introduction 📚

Ever wonder how digital assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant give such accurate answers to your questions? The magic behind this is called **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, which combines information retrieval with language generation techniques. A key player in this process is a **knowledge graph**, which helps these assistants access a huge pool of structured information to improve their responses. 🤖✨

## What You'll Learn 🧠

In this notebook, you will get hands-on experience to:
1. Create a knowledge graph from text data.
2. Store it in a database.
3. Use it to find relevant information for user queries.
